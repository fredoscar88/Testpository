Shift right click in windows explorer, hit "Open cmd line in this location" (or whatever it says)

run 'javac <filename>.java' to compile code

When running a .class, you must have that class in a file hierarchy that matches its package. For example, Main.class in package
henry.farr must be in the 'farr' folder which must be in the 'henry' folder, and where the henry folder is located is where the classpath
must be to run the class. In this example enter in 'java -cp . henry.farr.Main' to run the Main class.

We have some good bookmarks about class paths. The path environment variable is already set but will need updating when the next jdk
comes around.
